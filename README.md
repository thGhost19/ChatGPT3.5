# Discord ChatGPT3.5 Bot

This is a Discord bot that uses the ChatGPT API to generate responses to user messages. It's based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, which allows for more natural and engaging conversations with users.

## Getting Started

To use this bot, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a '.env' file with your Discord bot token and ChatGPT API key, like this:

```
 TOKEN=<your Discord bot token>
 API_KEY=<your ChatGPT API key>
 CHANNEL_ID=<your Discord Channel ID>
 ```
 
3. Install the required dependencies by running npm install.
4. Start the bot by running npm start. 
 
## Usage

Once the bot is up and running, you can start using it in your Discord server. Here are some example commands:

- !chat <message>: The bot will respond to your message with a generated response.
- !ping: The bot will respond with "Pong!" to let you know it's online.
- !help: The bot will provide a list of available commands.

You can customize the bot's behavior by editing the code in bot.js. For example, you can change the prefix for commands or modify the logic for generating responses.
